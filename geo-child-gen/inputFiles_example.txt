# This is a comment and shall be treated correctly while parsing this file

# This input file for GeoChildGen defines the set of input data to be processed
# It shall be used in all cases where
#  a) the number of files exceeds the capabilities of the shell
#  b) the files are spread over a lot of directories (maybe even recursive)
#
# Each line in this file is a separate expression that will be treated as one command
# Example:
/usr/local/data/MER_RR_1Pblabla.N1      # take only file
/usr/local/data/*.N1                    # take all files in directory that end with .N1
/usr/local/data/*/*.N1                  # take all files in any subdirectory of data that end with .N1
/usr/local/data/*                       # recurse through all files and subdirs
